// NOTE: helper wrappers for Redis/cache were removed in favor of direct calls to
// the `internal/infrastructure/cache` package to avoid cyclic import issues.
// Keep this file for documentation / future adapter registration if needed.

// Deprecated: no exported symbols. Use internal/infrastructure/cache package directly.
